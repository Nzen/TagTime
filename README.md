To determine how you spend your time, TagTime randomly samples you. At random times it pops up and asks what you're doing right at that moment. You answer with tags. For more on the idea behind this project, see [messymatters.com/tagtime](http://messymatters.com/tagtime).

## Progress bar branch

Tagtime waits 60 seconds for a reply before assuming you are afk. As I've had it close while I thought, perhaps it's better to warn me how long I have. That's this branch.
